# Testing using the CLI
when making changes to any scrapers, be sure to test when you're finished. You should test using the following CLI commands:
```
./scripts/cli.sh --url https://example.com --mode site // or --mode character
```
where you replace the `https://example.com` with the actual URL you want to test.

## Testing for sites
IMPORTANT: When testing scraping for sites, it is often expensive to scrape the entire site. That's why the flag for only scraping the first page exists (`first_page_only`). Unless specified, you should always leave this flag to true (True by default).
